- Check for HAVE_EVENTFD (eventfd support) and use alternatives as AIO Perl module does
	EFD_NONBLOCK and EFD_CLOEXEC are supported since Linux kernel 2.6.27
- OOP API?

- Fork support
After a fork php_eio_eventfd is copied to the new process. Consequences are
obvious - garbage in communication.

We should:
* create eio_init() userspace function allowing to re-create eventfd to the new
  process
* in eio_init() check whether we already have open event fd, and close if any
