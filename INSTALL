INSTALLATION OF EIO PECL EXTENSION
==================================

Currently GNU/Linux platforms supported only.


AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
----------------------

To download and install eio automatically you need the following commands

# pecl install eio

for stable release, and the following for beta release:

# pecl install eio-beta

If you have the package archive, unpack it and run: 

# pecl install package.xml

Note, these commands(started with `#') most likely need root priveleges.

Since version 0.4.0 beta libeio is embedded. So you don't need to install the
library separately.


MANUAL INSTALLATION
-------------------

Checkout the project or download it as archive. In the package directory run: 

$ phpize 
$ ./configure --with-eio --enable-eio-debug
$ make 

Optionally test the extension in CLI:
$ make test

Do install with root priveleges:
# make install

In php.ini, or some other configuration like
/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/eio.ini write:

extension=eio.so

NOTE 
To disable debug mode don't use --enable-eio-debug configuration option.
It's recommended to build with this flag first time though.


FINALLY
------

Restart the SAPI server(Apache, PHP-FPM etc.), if any.
