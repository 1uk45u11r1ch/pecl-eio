INSTALLATION OF LIBEIO PECL EXTENSION

Currently Linux platforms supported only.

Checkout the project or download it as archive. Then enter the librio directory
and issue the following commands.

1. INSTALL LIBEIO, IF IT IS NOT INSTALLED YET

$ touch ~/.cvspass
$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.schmorp.de/schmorpforge co libeio
$ cd libeio
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make 
# make install 

Note, the last command should be initiated with root priveleges, e.g.
$ sudo make install

2. INSTALL LIBEIO PHP EXTENSION

$ phpize 
$ ./configure --with-eio --enable-eio-debug
$ make 

Optionally test the extension in CLI:
$ make test

Do install with root priveleges:
# make install

NOTE: always check for current options and flags:
$ ./configure --help | grep eio

3. CONFIGURE PHP TO USE LIBEIO EXTENSION

In php.ini, or some other configuration like
/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/eio.ini write:

extension=eio.so

NOTE 
To disable debug mode don't use --enable-eio-debug configuration option.

NOTE
If you set a special path when configuring libeio itself(e.g. by means of
--prefix option), you can point to that location by means of --with-eio
option.

4. FINALLY

Restart the SAPI server(Apache, PHP-FPM etc.), if any.
